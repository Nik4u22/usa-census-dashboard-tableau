### Steps to create a dashboard using Tableau Desktop:

1. Connect to your data source: Open Tableau Desktop and connect to the data source that you want to use for your dashboard.

2. Create worksheets: Create worksheets by dragging and dropping fields from the data source onto the canvas. Each worksheet should contain a chart, graph, or other visualization that represents the data in a meaningful way.

3. Add filters: Add filters to the worksheets to allow users to interact with the data. Filters can be applied to one or more worksheets and can be used to drill down into specific data subsets.

4. Arrange the worksheets: Arrange the worksheets on the dashboard by dragging and dropping them onto the canvas. You can also add text boxes, images, and other elements to provide context and additional information.

5. Format the dashboard: Format the dashboard to make it visually appealing and easy to use. This can include adding color, adjusting the size and position of elements, and adding titles and labels.

6. Publish the dashboard: Once you are satisfied with the dashboard, you can publish it to Tableau Server or Tableau Online to share it with others. You can also export the dashboard as a PDF or image to share it outside of Tableau.

Keep in mind that these are just general steps and the specific process may vary depending on your data and requirements.
